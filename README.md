Waves
=====

Waves is a new blogging platform developed for the new decentralized web or a personal blog on a local computer. Waves uses a javasript JSON database to store content/entries and supports the MarkDown syntax for creating content. It works ideally with the XTTP firefox plugin so that a blog can be shared over the BitTorrent Sync platform.
