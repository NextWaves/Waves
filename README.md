Waves
=====

Waves is a new blogging platform developed for the new decentralized web or a personal blog on a local computer. Waves uses a javasript JSON database to store content/entries and supports the MarkDown syntax for creating content. It works ideally with the XTTP firefox plugin so that a blog can be shared over the BitTorrent Sync platform.

Intro to MeshedSites
=====

This is a quick overview of MeshedSites.com and the XTTP Firefox Plugin. 

The purpose of this project is to open up the decentralizeddis internet to everyone and make it easy to find sites. The idea is to promote free speech and the distribution of information. XTTP allows sites to exist on every computer that browses any XTTP site by using the BT Sync application. If the site has been viewed on a computer on the same network then the request never leaves the internal network. Sites will be loaded locally. This helps limit bandwidth since the browser does not have to make as many calls over the internet. Once the site is loaded on a users machine the user can view it anytime offline. Changes are uploaded when the user connects back to the internet.

The decentralized nature of the platform makes denial of service virtually impossible. Once the site is shared the originator of the site no longer needs to have their computer turned on to share the site. Now their peers help distribute the information but BT Sync ensures that the peers can not edit the information. When sharing ReadOnly keys the modified files are not shared unless they match the originators. 

This process can be used to share a site with the world or just to share a picture album with family. Record music and share tracks with your friends. Your size limitations are your own hard drive and once its shared your friends and family they act as backups in the event your hard drive crashes or other tragic event that would normal mean your files are lost forever.

The data is in the Cloud but its _YOUR_ cloud.
